Intermediate representations
============================

### What is an intermediate representation?
An intermediate representation is a target language internal to the compiler (like machine code).
A common intermediate representation simplifies the construction of compilers supporting multiple source and target languages.

### What is a translator?

A translator is a [compiler phase](#what-are-the-phases-of-a-compiler) which converts an [abstract syntax tree](#what-is-an-abstract-syntax-tree) into an [intermediate representation](#what-is-an-intermediate-representation).
